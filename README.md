# Simpo SDK

This is a dynamic framework which is distributed with closed sources.  
Latest version: 1.0.5

Installation instructions:
- [Carthage](#carthage)
- [CocoaPods](#cocoapods)

### Carthage

1. Install Carthage  
```bash
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$ brew install carthage
```
2. Create `Cartfile` in the project root dir with the content:  
```bash
github "vvit/SimpoSDK"
```
_TODO: update repo path_  
3. Install the dependency:  
```bash
carthage update --platform iOS
```
4. Add `Simpo.framework` (located in `<project-root>/Carthage/Build/iOS`) to the `Linked Frameworks and Libraries`:

5. Add a `Run Script` build phase with this content:

6. Optional if CocoaPods script exists (`[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks`).  
Solves the AppStore submission issue.  
Add a `Run Script` build phase with the name `Carthage Strip Architectures` and this content:
```bash
FRAMEWORK="Simpo"
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/$FRAMEWORK.framework/$FRAMEWORK"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()

echo "Stripping the Simpo framework"

for ARCH in $ARCHS
do
lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
done
lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
```

## CocoaPods

1. Install CocoaPods  
```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
2. If needed (first time) run:
```bash
pod init
```
3. Install the dependency by adding `pod 'SimpoTest'` _(TODO: update name)_ into the `Podfile`. Then run:
```bash
$ pod update
```

So the `Podfile` looks like this:  
```bash
platform :ios, '9.3'

target 'CocoapodExample' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'SimpoTest'
end
````
